# end-of-field-challenge
## Challenge :compass:
- Create pixel-perfect copies ONLY using CSS and HTML
- Either recreate 2 simple interfaces, or 1 simple and 1 complex, or all at once
- No frameworks are allowed
- `solo` : no help of fellow juniors 
- [Criteria](https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-verou-1-26/blob/master/1.The-Field/4.HTML-CSS/5.End-of-Field/2.End-of-Field-Challenge/Criteria.md) used for a well-structured result
- Use `git` and `GitHub` for deployment.

## Results :computer:
- [Interface 1](interface-1)

- [Interface 2](interface-4)

- [Complex 8](complex-8)

## Tools used :hammer_and_wrench:
Since Frameworks were not allowed, more work had to be done to measure pixels and use the right colors.

Here is a list of the used tools for this exercise:
- HTML and CSS
- Visual Studio Code
- W3Schools
- Google
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/home)
