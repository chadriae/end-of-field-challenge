## Create pixel-perfect copies ONLY using CSS and HTML 


### simple
#### Interface 1
- [Interface 1](interface-1)

#### Interface 4
- [Interface 2](interface-4)

### complex
#### Complex 8
- [Complex 8](complex-8)

## Remarks
The interfaces don't match pixel-perfect on the font-side. I purposly didn't spend way too much time on finding the exact font as I wanted to finish all the interfaces at the end of the day.
